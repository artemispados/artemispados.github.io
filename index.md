## Overview, Interests, and Objectives
Link to Statement of Purpose\
    My objective is to attend a world-renowned University and be a member of their women’s tennis team. This will allow me to pursue my passion for excellence in mathematics, sciences, and sports. As a student and athlete, I love mathematics and tennis with the same intensity. As I become more mature academically, I realize that what I love is building, step by step, an abstract mathematical world from fundamental principles. I aspire to study among the best and excel in whatever I choose to pursue. I hope to work with the ﬁnest mathematicians and scientists, to make new discoveries and contribute to the technological advancements of our society. After my undergraduate studies, I will move on to work toward a Ph.D. degree in Mathematics, Computer Science, or Engineering.\
    In tennis, I try to become as skilled a player as I can possibly be. Every day I train to grow my game and add a new element to my repertoire. I love this sport because it is a combination of physical, mental, technical, and tactical skills. I love this sport because it is a combination of physical, mental, technical, and tactical skills. It is an individual sport. When I step on the court, it is me and my opponent; that is all. Nobody interferes. It becomes a nobble battle between the two of us. I have myself to credit in victory, and myself to blame in defeat. I would describe my tennis game style as an all-court player. I like to structure my points by looking for a forehand after a strong serve and most of all by making my opponent uncomfortable. My biggest strength on the tennis court is my variety – from dropshots to heavy balls to serving and volleying, I feel that my touch is a dominating element of my strong doubles game.\
    I believe that my engagement with competitive sports helped me develop strong communication, time management and leadership skills as well as the ability to strategize, identify the details that make the difference in performance, set goals and execute while at the same time listen to constructive criticism and adjust accordingly. I hope I will be able to attend a highest quality academic program to study mathematics and be able to lead the university tennis team to championships.\
