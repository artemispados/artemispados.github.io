## Overview, Interests, and Objectives
Link to Statement of Purpose\
    My objective is to attend a world-renowned University and be a member of their women’s tennis team. This will allow me to pursue my passion for excellence in mathematics, sciences, and sports. As a student and athlete, I love mathematics and tennis with the same intensity. As I become more mature academically, I realize that what I love is building, step by step, an abstract mathematical world from fundamental principles. I aspire to study among the best and excel in whatever I choose to pursue. I hope to work with the ﬁnest mathematicians and scientists, to make new discoveries and contribute to the technological advancements of our society. After my undergraduate studies, I will move on to work toward a Ph.D. degree in Mathematics, Computer Science, or Engineering.\
    In tennis, I try to become as skilled a player as I can possibly be. Every day I train to grow my game and add a new element to my repertoire. I love this sport because it is a combination of physical, mental, technical, and tactical skills. I would describe my tennis game style as an all-court player. I like to structure my points by looking for a forehand after a strong serve and most of all by making my opponent uncomfortable. My biggest strength on the tennis court is my variety – from dropshots to heavy balls to serving and volleying, I feel that my touch is a dominating element of my strong doubles game
